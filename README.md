# **C Snake**

This project is a console-based Snake game implemented in C using the Windows Console API. The goal of the project is to demonstrate proficiency in programming concepts such as memory management, data structures, input handling, and real-time game loops, all within a constrained environment.
The game features classic Snake mechanics including movement, growth, collision detection, scoring, and persistent high score tracking.
